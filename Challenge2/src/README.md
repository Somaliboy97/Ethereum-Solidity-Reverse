## Spoiler Alert

If you are looking here first before trying challenge, then you might want to look at challenge first. TBH, challenges are kinda easier for first few levels compared writing solidity code in my POV. 
If you are planning to learn solidity language too, then go on and reproduce and test in IDE.
